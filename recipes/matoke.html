        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Matoke is a Ugandan stew made with Matoke (green bananas), vegetables, protein, and a spice mix.</p>
        <p>Matoke, also known as Matooke, is a traditional dish native to East Africa, particularly in Uganda. It is primarily made from green bananas, which are a type of cooking banana. These bananas are harvested when they're unripe and have a high starch content, making them perfect for cooking. In Uganda, Matoke is considered one of their national dishes and is often served mashed.</p>
